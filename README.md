# Vue.js test website

This project is part of my bachelor thesis with the topic of defining the best suited web technology for implementing a company intern component library as part of a design system. In order to do so, three component library prototypes are implemented along with test websites to use the implemented components. 

Here is an overview of the software parts of this bachelor thesis:

This project represents the **Vue.js test website** to test importing the Vue.js component library prototype to another project.

The links to all the parts of the bachelor thesis are listed below.

## Serve website

Run `npm start` to start a dev server which serves the website locally, then navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
